# Risk of Rain 2 Ultrakill Scoring Mod

Using a ROR2 (Risk of Rain 2) boilerplate, this mod takes the [scoring from Ultrakill](https://ultrakill.wiki.gg/wiki/Style) (excluding the bonus style points, as it would be too much effort for this mod specifically)

This mod is incomplete, it needs:
- Implement the actual style visuals (the messages showing your current style level)
